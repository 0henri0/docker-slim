Creating small containers requires a lot of voodoo magic and it can be pretty painful. You shouldn't have to throw away your tools and your workflow to have skinny containers. Using Docker should be easy. 

`docker-slim` is a magic diet pill for your containers :) It will use static and dynamic analysis to create a skinny container for your app.
